/** One arranger row, hosting every clip currently assigned to this channel
 * (see channelOf in store.ts) — could be exactly one clip (today's default,
 * unchanged visually) or several sharing the row, each still positioned by
 * its own clipGeometry exactly as RifffBlockRow already does; if two
 * overlap in time they'll visually overlap too; z-order (which one's on
 * top) follows plain array order, matching the design spec.
 *
 * This component owns the row's own onDrop, stopping propagation so a drop
 * landing here reassigns the dragged clip's channel to THIS one (see
 * App.tsx's Timeline, which supplies onDropOnChannel) rather than falling
 * through to the Timeline container's own fallback (which always means
 * "give it a brand new channel instead"). */
